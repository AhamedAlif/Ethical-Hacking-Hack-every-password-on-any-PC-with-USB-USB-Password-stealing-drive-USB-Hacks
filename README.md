# Ethical Hacking | Hack Every Password on Any PC with USB

## USB Password Stealing Drive

Welcome to our project, where we explore the realm of ethical hacking using a USB password stealing drive. With this project, we aim to raise awareness about the potential risks associated with USB devices and demonstrate the importance of proper security measures.

### Project Overview

Our project focuses on creating a USB device capable of extracting passwords from various PCs. However, it's important to emphasize that this project is strictly for educational and ethical purposes. We aim to highlight vulnerabilities and provide insights into securing systems against potential threats.

### Features

- Custom-built USB device capable of silently extracting passwords from target PCs.
- Implementation of password capturing techniques for educational purposes.
- Detailed documentation and guidelines on securing systems against USB-based attacks.
- Discussion of ethical hacking principles and responsible disclosure.

### Disclaimer

We would like to emphasize that unauthorized use of the techniques demonstrated in this project is strictly prohibited. It's essential to respect privacy and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines. This project is meant to educate and raise awareness about potential vulnerabilities, not to encourage any malicious activities.

### Contribution

We welcome contributions from the ethical hacking community and individuals interested in USB security. Feel free to submit pull requests, suggest improvements, or report any issues you encounter. Let's work together to enhance the security of systems and promote responsible hacking practices.
